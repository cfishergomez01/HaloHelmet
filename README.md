All files are coded for use with MATLAB. 
File and variable names can be adjusted if needed, current files follow the naming scheme our team followed during testing. 
Truncating and averaging are inputted manually for each impact direction/anchor point location due to the sheer amount of folders and files at the beginning of the process.
